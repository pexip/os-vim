vim (2:7.3.154+hg~74503f6ee649-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The vim-lesstif package has been removed in favor of the new vim-athena
  package.  The intent behind both packages is to provide a lighter-weight GUI
  package as well as one that allows using XFLD fonts.  The Athena toolkit,
  however,  has broader usage and reduces divergences with downstream
  distributions.

vim (2:7.2c.000-1) experimental; urgency=low

  The autoindent option is no longer enabled by default because:
  - 'autoindent' is rather na√Øve and turning on filetype-specific indentation
    (via "filetype indent on") is usually a better choice.
  - not having any automatic indenting enabled by default prevents new users
    from encountering the bad indentation issue when pasting text.

  Filetype plugins are no longer enabled by default because certain actions
  (like preventing the loading of the default menus) *must* occur before
  filetype detection is enabled.  By enabling filetype plugins (and detection)
  in debian.vim, we are preventing the user from being able to make changes to
  Vim's behavior.  Filetype plugins can be re-enabled via
  "filetype plugin on".

vim (1:7.1.285-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Due to popular demand (and general conformity with other filetype plugins),
  the debchangelog and debcontrol filetype plugins no longer enable folding by
  default.  If you wish to enable their folding, you can add the following
  commands to your ~/.vimrc for debchangelog and debcontrol, respectively:

    let g:debchangelog_fold_enable = 1
    let g:debcontrol_fold_enable = 1

  * /usr/share/vim/addons/ is no longer in the vim runtimepath

    This is intended to avoid arbitrarly clashes among addons installed
    system-wide and enabled by default, and to set up a common ground for Vim
    extensions of various kinds.  From now on vim addons won't be enabled by
    default upon installation but will need to be enabled on a per-addon basis
    either in a system-wide manner (affecting all users of the system) or by
    each user who wants to use them.  A tool exists for helping with addon
    management: it is called "vim-addons" and is shipped by the package
    "vim-addon-manager"; all vim addon packages should recommend it.

    For more information see the VIM packaging policy (available on the web at
    http://pkg-vim.alioth.debian.org/vim-policy.html/index.html) and the
    manual page of vim-addons, available in the vim-addon-manager package.
