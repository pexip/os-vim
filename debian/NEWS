vim (2:8.0.0022-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Vim now ships with a defaults.vim file which, when the user has no vimrc,
  enables some options that have historically been disabled by default.  This
  is described in more detail at ":help defaults.vim".

  Since defaults.vim is loaded when the user's vimrc would typically be
  loaded, it will override any settings in /etc/vim/vimrc(.local).  In order
  to disable the loading of defaults.vim, add

    let g:skip_defaults_vim = 1

  to /etc/vim/vimrc(.local).
